 *			ultimately by some call to driver_register(),
 *			bus_add_driver(), or driver_attach()).
 * @remove:		Called when a new device is removed, by our remove()
 *			function specified by driver.remove() (triggered
 *			ultimately by some call to device_release_driver()).
 * @channel_interrupt:	Called periodically, whenever there is a possiblity
 *			that "something interesting" may have happened to the
 *			channel.
 * @pause:		Called to initiate a change of the device's state.  If
 *			the return valu`e is < 0, there was an error and the

/**
 * visorbus_register_visor_driver() - registers the provided driver
 * @struct visor_driver *: the driver to register
 *
 * A particular type of visor driver calls this function to register
 * the driver.  The caller MUST fill in the following fields within the
 * #drv structure:
 *     name, version, owner, channel_types, probe, remove
 *
 * Here's how the whole Linux bus / driver / device model works.
 *
 * At system start-up, the visorbus kernel module is loaded, which registers
 * visorbus_type as a bus type, using bus_register().
 *
 * All kernel modules that support particular device types on a
 * visorbus bus are loaded.  Each of these kernel modules calls
 * visorbus_register_visor_driver() in their init functions, passing a
 * visor_driver struct.  visorbus_register_visor_driver() in turn calls
 * register_driver(&visor_driver.driver).  This .driver member is
 * initialized with generic methods (like probe), whose sole responsibility
 * is to act as a broker for the real methods, which are within the
 * visor_driver struct.  (This is the way the subclass behavior is
 * implemented, since visor_driver is essentially a subclass of the
 * generic driver.)  Whenever a driver_register() happens, core bus code in
 * the kernel does (see device_attach() in drivers/base/dd.c):
 *
 *     for each dev associated with the bus (the bus that driver is on) that
 *     does not yet have a driver
 *         if bus.match(dev,newdriver) == yes_matched  ** .match specified
 *                                                ** during bus_register().
 *             newdriver.probe(dev)  ** for visor drivers, this will call
 *                   ** the generic driver.probe implemented in visorbus.c,
 *                   ** which in turn calls the probe specified within the
 *                   ** struct visor_driver (which was specified by the
 *                   ** actual device driver as part of
 *                   ** visorbus_register_visor_driver()).
 *
 * The above dance also happens when a new device appears.
 * So the question is, how are devices created within the system?
 * Basically, just call device_add(dev).  See pci_bus_add_devices().
 * pci_scan_device() shows an example of how to build a device struct.  It
 * returns the newly-created struct to pci_scan_single_device(), who adds it
 * to the list of devices at PCIBUS.devices.  That list of devices is what
 * is traversed by pci_bus_add_devices().
 *
